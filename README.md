# my_hunter

In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt).
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:

- the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.
- ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.
- the player can click on them to shoot them.

## My idea

I've been playing Valorant for a while so I had the idea of trying to replicate the Valorant shooting range.
It's kind of the same as a classic my_hunter, the graphics are just different.
